# ESP32-DIY-Smart-Menu
This project is about creating a self-made smart menu for coffee shops using ESP32 to stream images via Wi-Fi and update prices

DESCRIPTION
"Since I usually enjoy drinking coffee every day and have a dream of opening a modern coffee shop with smart services for customers, one day I went to a certain coffee shop and saw that their menu was static. This sparked the idea that if the menu could be made into moving images and change dynamically, it would make it more appealing."
